%operating characteristic curve. This results in a normalized psth with
%possible values ranging from 0 to 1, with .5 being equal to baseline.
%This function does not use the typical pre and post inputs to determine the baseline bins and instead
%uses baseline_time and event_time inputs to determine which bins to use
%for baseline. This is done so that taste events, in which true baseline is
%3s prior to taste, can be input


%The baseline can either be input to the function (for events such as taste
%events in which the baseline is taken from outside the psth window.
if ~isempty(varargin)

%This creates a matrix of the baseline activity

%Sliding_Probability
